# Computer Vision

This repository contains 3 computer vision projects developed during a Computer Vision module.

## Corner Detection - Image Stitching

In the first part, Harris Corner Detection is implemented from scratch. For the second part, a panorama is stitched using different images of the same location from slightly different viewpoints. For the panorama cylindrical warping is also implemented.

## Image Segmentation

In this project, the K-Means clustering algorithm and Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation method are implemented in order to segment an image.

## Sparse 3D Reconstruction
Lastly, in this project a 3D scene is reconstructed based on a stereo pair of images.
